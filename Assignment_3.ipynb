Self-normalizing property:** SELU activation has a\n","> self-normalizing property, meaning that it preserves the mean and\n","> variance of the input to each layer, enabling the network to stabilize\n","> and propagate signals effectively. This property helps alleviate the\n","> vanishing/exploding gradient problem often encountered in deep neural\n","> networks, making it easier to train deeper architectures.\n",">\n","> **2. Continuous and smooth:** SELU is a smooth and continuously\n","> differentiable activation function, unlike ReLU, which has a\n","> discontinuity at zero. The smoothness of SELU makes it more suitable\n","> for optimization techniques that rely on gradient information, such as\n","> gradient descent algorithms. The lack of discontinuities in SELU\n","> allows for more stable and efficient optimization.\n",">\n","> **3. Automatic adjustment of scale and shift:** SELU includes\n","> parameters for scale and shift, allowing the activation function to\n","> adapt to the distribution of inputs. These parameters enable SELU to\n","> learn the optimal values for scaling and shifting the activations,\n","> improving the learning process. In contrast, ReLU does not have such\n","> adaptive capabilities, relying solely on a fixed threshold to\n","> determine activation.\n",">\n","> It's important to note that while SELU has these advantages, its\n","> effective usage requires specific conditions, such as certain weight\n","> initialization schemes (e.g., LeCun initialization) and specific\n","> network architectures. Additionally, SELU may not always outperform\n","> ReLU in all scenarios, and its benefits may vary depending on the\n","> specific task and data distribution.\n","\n","Q4.  **In which cases would you want to use each of the following\n","    activation functions: SELU, leaky ReLU (and its variants), ReLU,\n","    tanh, logistic, and softmax?**\n","\n","> Different activation functions have their own strengths and are\n","> suitable for different scenarios. **Here's a breakdown of when you\n","> might want to use each of the activation functions you mentioned:**\n",">\n","> **1. SELU:**\n",">\n","> \\- Use SELU when training deep neural networks and you want to benefit\n","> from its self-normalizing property, which helps stabilize and\n","> propagate signals effectively.\n",">\n","> \\- SELU can be particularly useful in architectures with many layers,\n","> where vanishing/exploding gradients are a common issue.\n",">\n","> **2. Leaky ReLU:**\n",">\n","> its variants (e.g., Parametric ReLU, Exponential Linear Unit - ELU):\n",">\n","> \\- Use leaky ReLU and its variants when you want to address the \"dying\n","> ReLU\" problem, which occurs when ReLU neurons become inactive and stop\n","> learning.\n",">\n","> \\- Leaky ReLU allows small negative values, which can help with\n","> gradient flow and prevent dead neurons.\n",">\n","> \\- Variants like Parametric ReLU and ELU introduce additional\n","> parameters to adjust the slope or shape of the activation function,\n","> providing more flexibility in modeling.\n",">\n","> **3. ReLU:**\n",">\n","> \\- ReLU is a popular choice in most scenarios and can be used as a\n","> default activation function for hidden layers in deep neural networks.\n",">\n","> \\- It is computationally efficient and has been successful in many\n","> applications.\n",">\n","> \\- Use ReLU when you want a simple, non-linear activation function\n","> that promotes sparsity and can handle a wide range of problems\n","> effectively.\n",">\n","> **4. Tanh (hyperbolic tangent):**\n",">\n","> \\- Tanh is commonly used in scenarios where you need an activation\n","> function that maps inputs to a range between -1 and 1.\n",">\n","> \\- It is useful for modeling and capturing non-linearities in the data\n","> while preserving negative and positive values.\n",">\n","> **5. Logistic (Sigmoid):**\n",">\n","> \\- Use logistic activation when you want to map inputs to a range\n","> between 0 and 1.\n",">\n","> \\- It is commonly used in binary classification tasks where you need a\n","> probability-like output.\n",">\n","> \\- However, it is less frequently used in hidden layers of deep neural\n","> networks due to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",">\n","> **6. Softmax:**\n",">\n","> \\- Softmax activation is primarily used in the output layer of a\n","> neural network for multi-class classification problems.\n",">\n","> \\- It normalizes the output into a probability distribution, assigning\n","> probabilities to each class.\n",">\n","> \\- Softmax ensures that the sum of probabilities across all classes\n","> adds up to 1, making it suitable for multi-class classification tasks.\n",">\n","> Remember that the choice of activation function also depends on the\n","> characteristics of your data, the architecture of your network, and\n","> the specific requirements of your task. Experimentation and\n","> fine-tuning may be necessary to find the best activation function for\n","> a given scenario.\n","\n","Q5.  **What may happen if you set the momentum hyperparameter too close\n","    to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer?**\n","\n","> When the momentum hyperparameter in stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\n","> optimization is set too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999), it can lead to\n","> undesired effects and hinder the convergence of the optimization\n","> process. **Here are a few issues that may arise:**\n",">\n","> **1. Overshooting and unstable updates:** The momentum term in SGD\n","> allows the optimizer to accumulate past gradients and maintain a\n","> moving average of the gradients. When the momentum value is very close\n","> to 1, the updates become highly influenced by the accumulated\n","> gradients from previous iterations. As a result, the optimizer may\n","> overshoot the optimal solution and exhibit unstable behavior,\n","> oscillating or diverging instead of converging.\n",">\n","> **2. Slower convergence:** With an excessively high momentum value,\n","> the optimizer may have difficulty converging to the optimal solution\n","> efficiently. The momentum term can prevent the optimizer from making\n","> rapid adjustments to the weights and bias values, slowing down the\n","> convergence process. This can result in longer training times and\n","> suboptimal performance.\n",">\n","> **3. Escaping local optima:** Momentum is often used to escape local\n","> optima and plateaus during optimization. However, setting the momentum\n","> too close to 1 can make it difficult for the optimizer to explore\n","> different areas of the optimization landscape. The accumulated\n","> momentum can cause the optimizer to get trapped in regions that are\n","> far from the global optimum, reducing its ability to find the best\n","> solution.\n",">\n","> It is worth noting that the optimal value for the momentum\n","> hyperparameter depends on the specific problem, dataset, and\n","> architecture being trained. Typically, values around 0.9 or lower are\n","> commonly used, striking a balance between exploration and\n","> exploitation. However, it is crucial to experiment and tune the\n","> momentum value based on the specific task at hand to achieve the best\n","> results.\n","\n","Q6.  **Name three ways you can produce a sparse model.**\n","\n","> Here are three ways to produce a sparse model, **where sparse refers\n","> to having a smaller number of non-zero weights or activations:**\n",">\n","> **1. L1 regularization (Lasso regularization):**\n",">\n","> \\- By adding an L1 regularization term to the loss function during\n","> training, you can encourage sparsity in the model.\n",">\n","> \\- L1 regularization introduces a penalty term proportional to the\n","> absolute value of the weights, promoting some weights to become\n","> exactly zero.\n",">\n","> \\- As a result, the model tends to select a subset of the most\n","> important features or connections while setting others to zero,\n","> effectively creating sparsity.\n",">\n","> **2. Dropout:**\n",">\n","> \\- Dropout is a regularization technique where, during training,\n","> randomly selected neurons are temporarily \"dropped out\" by setting\n","> their activations to zero.\n",">\n","> \\- By dropping out neurons, the model learns to be robust and not rely\n","> heavily on specific neurons, encouraging redundancy and allowing other\n","> neurons to take over their responsibilities.\n",">\n","> \\- Dropout effectively produces a sparse representation in the\n","> network, as only a subset of neurons is active during each training\n","> iteration.\n",">\n","> **3. Pruning:**\n",">\n","> \\- Pruning involves removing or setting weights or connections in the\n","> model to zero based on their magnitudes or other criteria.\n",">\n","> \\- Various pruning techniques can be employed, such as magnitude-based\n","> pruning or structured pruning (e.g., pruning entire neurons, channels,\n","> or layers).\n",">\n","> \\- Pruning removes unnecessary connections or parameters, resulting in\n","> a sparser model while often maintaining or even improving its\n","> performance.\n",">\n","> \\- Pruning can be done during or after training, and a combination of\n","> pruning and fine-tuning can yield even more compact and efficient\n","> models.\n",">\n","> These techniques provide different approaches to achieving sparsity in\n","> models, each with its own advantages and considerations. It's worth\n","> noting that the degree of sparsity can be controlled by\n","> hyperparameters or criteria specific to each method, and finding the\n","> right balance is crucial to achieve the desired trade-off between\n","> sparsity and model performance.\n","\n","Q7.  **Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference\n","    (i.e., making predictions on new instances)? What about MC\n","    Dropout?**\n","\n","> Dropout can indeed slightly slow down the training process, but it can\n","> offer benefits in terms of regularization and generalization. **Here's\n","> an overview of the impact of dropout on training and inference, as\n","> well as the role of MC Dropout:**\n",">\n","> **1. Training speed:** Dropout can lead to slower training compared to\n","> models without dropout. During training, dropout randomly sets a\n","> portion of the neuron activations to zero, effectively reducing the\n","> effective capacity of the network. As a result, more training\n","> iterations may be needed to converge to the optimal solution. However,\n","> the slowdown is typically modest and can be mitigated by using\n","> techniques like batch normalization or efficient implementations.\n",">\n","> **2. Inference speed:** Dropout does not affect inference speed\n","> significantly. During inference, when making predictions on new\n","> instances, dropout is typically turned off, and all neurons remain\n","> active. As a result, there is no computational overhead from dropout\n","> during inference, and the prediction time is not noticeably impacted.\n",">\n","> **3. MC Dropout:** MC Dropout (Monte Carlo Dropout) extends dropout to\n","> the inference phase by applying dropout multiple times to obtain\n","> probabilistic predictions. Instead of turning off dropout during\n","> inference, MC Dropout samples from the dropout mask several times to\n","> obtain predictions with uncertainty estimates.\n",">\n","> \\- MC Dropout can introduce additional computational overhead during\n","> inference since multiple forward passes are required to obtain\n","> probabilistic predictions.\n",">\n","> \\- However, the inference time increase is still relatively modest,\n","> especially in comparison to other probabilistic modeling techniques.\n",">\n","> \\- MC Dropout provides valuable uncertainty estimation, which can be\n","> useful in applications such as Bayesian deep learning, active\n","> learning, and model confidence estimation.\n","\n","Q8.  **Practice training a deep neural network on the CIFAR10 image\n","    dataset:**\n","\n","    1.
