Biological Neuron:**\n",">\n","> Biological neurons are the fundamental building blocks of the human\n","> nervous system and serve as the inspiration for artificial neural\n","> networks. They consist of three main components: the cell body (soma),\n","> dendrites, and an axon. The dendrites receive signals from other\n","> neurons, which are transmitted as electrical impulses to the cell\n","> body. If the input signals reach a certain threshold, the neuron fires\n","> an output signal along its axon, which can then stimulate other\n","> neurons. This process allows for the transmission and processing of\n","> information in the brain. Artificial neural networks attempt to mimic\n","> the behavior of biological neurons through artificial neurons, which\n","> perform similar computations and transmit signals between layers.\n",">\n","> **ii. ReLU Function:**\n",">\n","> ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an activation function commonly used\n","> in artificial neural networks. It is defined as f(x) = max(0, x),\n","> where x is the input to the function. The ReLU function applies a\n","> linear transformation to the input and sets any negative values to\n","> zero, effectively \"rectifying\" the input. The ReLU function is\n","> preferred over other activation functions, such as sigmoid or tanh,\n","> due to several advantages. It is computationally efficient to compute\n","> and has a more biologically plausible behavior, as it models the\n","> firing of a neuron when the input exceeds a certain threshold. ReLU\n","> helps neural networks learn faster and avoids the vanishing gradient\n","> problem, which can occur with other activation functions. However,\n","> ReLU suffers from the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where neurons can become\n","> permanently inactive and cease to contribute to the learning process\n","> if they consistently receive negative inputs. This issue can be\n","> mitigated through techniques like leaky ReLU or parametric ReLU.\n",">\n","> **Please let me know if you would like short notes on any other\n","> topics.**\n",">\n","> **iii.** **Single-layer feed forward ANN**\n",">\n","> A single-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), also known\n","> as a single-layer perceptron, is the simplest form of a neural network\n","> architecture. It consists of a single layer of artificial neurons\n","> (perceptrons) that are arranged in a sequential manner. Each neuron in\n","> the input layer is connected to every neuron in the output layer, and\n","> there are no connections between neurons within the same layer or\n","> across multiple layers.\n",">\n","> **Here are some key characteristics of a single-layer feedforward\n","> ANN:**\n",">\n","> **1. Input Layer:** The input layer of the network receives the input\n","> data or features of the problem being addressed. Each neuron in the\n","> input layer represents a feature or attribute of the input data. The\n","> values of the input neurons are propagated forward without any\n","> processing or computation.\n",">\n","> **2. Weights and Connections:** Each connection between an input\n","> neuron and an output neuron is associated with a weight, which\n","> represents the strength or importance of that connection. The weights\n","> are adjustable parameters that the network learns during the training\n","> process to optimize its performance.\n",">\n","> **3. Activation Function:** Each neuron in the output layer performs a\n","> weighted sum of its input values, followed by the application of an\n","> activation function. The activation function introduces non-linearity\n","> into the network and determines the output value of the neuron based\n","> on the weighted sum. Common activation functions used in single-layer\n","> feedforward ANNs include the step function, sigmoid function, or\n","> linear function.\n",">\n","> **4. Output Layer:** The output layer consists of neurons that produce\n","> the final output of the network. The number of neurons in the output\n","> layer depends on the type of problem being solved. For binary\n","> classification, a single neuron is used, while for multi-class\n","> classification, the number of neurons corresponds to the number of\n","> classes.\n",">\n","> **5. Learning and Training:** The learning process of a single-layer\n","> feedforward network typically involves a supervised learning\n","> algorithm. During training, the network adjusts the weights based on\n","> the difference between its output and the target output, aiming to\n","> minimize the error or loss function. This process is often performed\n","> using optimization techniques like gradient descent.\n",">\n","> Single-layer feedforward ANNs are most effective in solving problems\n","> that have linearly separable data. They can be used for simple\n","> classification tasks like the logical AND or OR operations. However,\n","> they are limited in their ability to solve more complex problems that\n","> require non-linear decision boundaries, such as the XOR operation. To\n","> address these limitations, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with hidden\n","> layers were developed, allowing for the representation of non-linear\n","> relationships and more powerful learning capabilities.\n",">\n","> **iv. Gradient Descent:**\n",">\n","> Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine\n","> learning, including training artificial neural networks. Its purpose\n","> is to iteratively update the parameters of a model in order to\n","> minimize a given loss function. The basic idea behind gradient descent\n","> is to compute the gradient (derivative) of the loss function with\n","> respect to the model's parameters and update the parameters in the\n","> direction of steepest descent.\n",">\n","> **Here are the key steps involved in the gradient descent algorithm:**\n",">\n","> **1. Initialization:** Initialize the model's parameters (weights and\n","> biases) with random or predefined values.\n",">\n","> **2. Forward Propagation:** Pass the input data through the model,\n","> calculating the predicted output.\n",">\n","> **3. Loss Calculation:** Compute the value of the loss function, which\n","> quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted output and the actual\n","> target output.\n",">\n","> **4. Backpropagation:** Compute the gradients of the loss function\n","> with respect to each parameter using the chain rule of derivatives.\n","> This involves propagating the error backward through the layers of the\n","> neural network.\n",">\n","> **5. Parameter Update:** Update the parameters by subtracting a\n","> fraction of the gradients from the current parameter values. The\n","> fraction is determined by the learning rate, which controls the step\n","> size of the updates.\n",">\n","> **6. Repeat:** Iterate steps 2-5 for a fixed number of iterations or\n","> until a convergence criterion is met. Convergence is typically\n","> determined by observing the change in the loss function or the\n","> magnitude of the gradients.\n",">\n","> There are different variants of gradient descent, such as batch\n","> gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and mini-batch\n","> gradient descent. In batch gradient descent, the entire training\n","> dataset is used to compute the gradients and update the parameters in\n","> each iteration. Stochastic gradient descent updates the parameters\n","> after processing each individual training sample. Mini-batch gradient\n","> descent is a compromise between batch and stochastic gradient descent,\n","> where a subset (mini-batch) of training samples is used for each\n","> parameter update.\n",">\n","> **v. Recurrent Networks:**\n",">\n","> Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural\n","> network designed to handle sequential or time-dependent data. They\n","> have connections between neurons that form directed cycles, allowing\n","> them to retain information from previous time steps and exhibit\n","> dynamic temporal behavior.\n",">\n","> **Key features of recurrent networks include:**\n",">\n","> **1. Recurrent Connections**: RNNs have recurrent connections that\n","> allow information to flow from one time step to the next. This enables\n","> the network to process sequential data of arbitrary length and capture\n","> temporal dependencies.\n",">\n","> **2. Hidden State:** RNNs maintain a hidden state vector that serves\n","> as a memory of the network. The hidden state evolves as the network\n","> processes each input, integrating information from both the current\n","> input and previous inputs.\n",">\n","> **3. Time Unfolding:** To facilitate training, RNNs are often\n","> \"unfolded\" or expanded in time, creating a series of interconnected\n","> layers corresponding to each time step. This unfolded representation\n","> makes it easier to apply standard backpropagation algorithms for\n","> training.\n",">\n","> **4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):**\n","> RNNs can suffer from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem,\n","> which hampers their ability to learn long-term dependencies. To\n","> address this, specialized architectures such as LSTM and GRU were\n","> developed. These architectures introduce gating mechanisms that\n","> regulate the flow of information through the network, allowing for\n","> better handling of long-term dependencies.\n",">\n","> RNNs are widely used in applications that involve sequential data,\n","> such as natural language processing, speech recognition, machine\n","> translation, and time series analysis. They excel in tasks that\n","> require modeling of sequential patterns, capturing context, and making\n","> predictions based on historical information."],"id":"PEZ8Vyo5GC2Y"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]}}}
