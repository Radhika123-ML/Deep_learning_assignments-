Smoothness and Continuity: The** ELU activation function is\n","> smooth and differentiable everywhere, including the point of origin\n","> (x=0). In contrast, the ReLU function is not differentiable at x=0.\n","> The smoothness of ELU can help in mitigating some of the issues\n","> related to dead neurons and vanishing gradients that can occur with\n","> ReLU.\n",">\n","> **2. Negative Activation Handling:** ELU allows for negative\n","> activations, which can be useful in certain scenarios. Unlike ReLU,\n","> where negative activations are simply truncated to zero, ELU can\n","> capture and propagate negative values. This can help the network model\n","> both positive and negative information in the data, potentially\n","> leading to improved representation learning.\n",">\n","> **3. Robustness to Noise:** ELU is more robust to noisy input compared\n","> to ReLU. The negative activation range in ELU helps prevent the\n","> saturation of neurons, allowing them to still produce meaningful\n","> outputs even in the presence of noise. ReLU, on the other hand, can\n","> completely deactivate neurons if their input falls below zero, making\n","> them less resilient to noise.\n",">\n","> While ELU offers these advantages, it's important to note that the\n","> choice of activation function depends on the specific problem,\n","> architecture, and data characteristics.

Overshooting and Instability:** Momentum in optimization\n","> algorithms helps to accelerate the learning process by accumulating\n","> gradients from previous steps. When the momentum hyperparameter is set\n","> extremely close to 1, the accumulated momentum becomes very high. This\n","> can lead to overshooting the optimal solution and causing instability\n","> in the optimization process. The optimizer may oscillate around the\n","> optimal point or even diverge.\n",">\n","> **2. Difficulty in Escaping Local Minima:** High momentum values can\n","> make it challenging for the optimizer to escape local minima. When the\n","> momentum is close to 1, the optimizer tends to continue moving in the\n","> same direction with strong momentum. This behavior can make it harder\n","> for the optimizer to explore alternative directions and find better\n","> optima in the presence of local minima.\n",">\n","> **3. Slow Convergence:** While high momentum can help speed up\n","> convergence initially, setting it extremely close to 1 may cause slow\n","> convergence or even convergence failure. The accumulated momentum can\n","> cause the optimizer to overshoot the optimal solution repeatedly,\n","> resulting in slow progress towards convergence.\n",">\n","> **4. Reduced Exploration:** With very high momentum, the optimizer\n","> relies heavily on the accumulated momentum, which reduces its ability\n","> to explore different regions of the parameter space. This limitation\n","> can hinder the optimizer's ability to discover better solutions and\n","> prevent it from exploring the full landscape of the optimization\n","> problem.\n",">\n","> In practice, it is common to set the momentum hyperparameter to a\n","> value between 0.8 and 0.9. These values strike a balance between the\n","> benefits of accelerated convergence and stability during optimization.\n","> Adjusting the momentum hyperparameter within this range can help\n","> prevent the aforementioned issues and facilitate efficient and\n","> effective optimization.\n","\n","Q6.  **Name three ways you can produce a sparse model.**\n","\n","> Here are three ways to produce a sparse model:\n",">\n","> **1. L1 Regularization (Lasso regularization):**\n",">\n","> L1 regularization encourages sparsity in models by adding a penalty\n","> term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute values\n","> of the model's weights. The L1 penalty promotes many weights to become\n","> exactly zero, effectively eliminating their contribution to the model.\n","> This results in a sparse model where only a subset of the features or\n","> parameters are actively used.\n",">\n","> **2. Dropout:**\n",">\n","> Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of\n","> the input units or activations to zero during each training iteration.\n","> By randomly \"dropping out\" units, dropout encourages the model to\n","> learn redundant representations and distribute the learning across\n","> different subsets of units. This can result in a more robust and\n","> sparse model that is less reliant on individual units or features.\n",">\n","> **3. Feature Selection**:\n",">\n","> Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant\n","> features or variables from the original dataset. By carefully choosing\n","> the most informative features, you can create a sparse model that\n","> focuses on the most important inputs. There are various feature\n","> selection techniques available, such as correlation-based methods,\n","> information gain, forward/backward selection, and regularized\n","> regression models.\n",">\n","> It's worth noting that producing a sparse model is not always\n","> desirable or necessary. Sparse models can have benefits such as\n","> interpretability, reduced memory footprint, and computational\n","> efficiency, but they might sacrifice some predictive performance. The\n","> choice of whether to pursue sparsity depends on the specific\n","> requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.\n","\n","Q7.  **Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference\n","    (i.e., making predictions on new instances)?**\n","\n","> Dropout can indeed slow down the training process to some extent, but\n","> its impact on inference, or making predictions on new instances, is\n","> minimal. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",">\n","> **During training:**\n",">\n","> \\- Dropout introduces randomness by randomly zeroing out a fraction of\n","> the input units or activations. This effectively creates an ensemble\n","> of \"thinned\" networks with different subsets of units active at each\n","> iteration.\n",">\n","> \\- The randomness introduced by dropout leads to a form of implicit\n","> model averaging, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the\n","> model's generalization ability.\n",">\n","> \\- However, because dropout requires computations for each training\n","> example and iteration, it can increase the overall training time\n","> compared to models without dropout.\n",">\n","> **During inference (prediction on new instances):**\n",">\n","> \\- Dropout is not applied during inference or prediction time. The\n","> model uses all the units or activations, without any dropout-induced\n","> random zeroing.\n",">\n","> \\- Consequently, inference with a trained dropout model is usually\n","> faster than the corresponding training process, as there is no\n","> overhead from dropout computations.\n",">\n","> \\- Dropout's effects are approximated during inference by scaling the\n","> weights by the dropout rate to ensure consistency with the training\n","> process.\n",">\n","> It's worth noting that while dropout may slow down the training\n","> process, its regularization benefits and improvement in generalization\n","> often outweigh the slight increase in training time. Dropout helps\n","> prevent overfitting and can lead to better performance on unseen data,\n","> even if it requires more iterations during training. During inference,\n","> the absence of dropout ensures efficient and speedy predictions.\n",">\n","> Furthermore, it's worth exploring techniques like batch normalization\n","> and approximate inference methods, which can help mitigate the\n","> computational overhead of dropout during training, making it more\n","> efficient while retaining its regularization benefits."],"id":"SGu99oLuMX6v"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]}}}
